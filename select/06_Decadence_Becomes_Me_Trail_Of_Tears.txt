Decadence becomes me
Halfway into the second glass
As I sit indulging in my mental filth

Depraved
Deprived
Indulge with me and kill your pride
Sin is in so join the fold
Let the only truth be told

Decadence becomes me
As my mind is getting sick
Taken into hopeless solitude
Decadence becomes me
As I'm heading to the floor
Someday I'll be out to have some more

Decadence becomes me
Halfway into the seventh glass
My senses shaken as the green ones pass

Depraved
Deprived
My image bleeds before your eyes
Sin is in so join the fold
Forget the rules that you were told

I feel the light escape my soul
Trying to gain control
Temptations everywhere
And I dare not resist
No I dare not resist
I'm too weak to turn away
