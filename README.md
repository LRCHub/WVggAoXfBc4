# Disturbed – Decadence

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
say, yes they know that you
fought yourself another time
don't they know that
you're full of blame already
yes they know that you
fought yourself another time
decadence isn't easy, is it
yes they know that you
fought yourself another time
don't they know that
you're full of blame already
yes they know that you
fought yourself another time
decadence isn't easy
slowly recall all your mind
why, your soul's gone cold
and your hope has run dry
dead inside
never enough to forget
that you're one of the lonely
slowly recall all your mind
<♪>
say, yes they know
that you fought
yourself another time
don't they know that
you're full of blame already
yes they know that you
fought yourself another time
decadence isn't easy, is it
yes they know that you
fought yourself another time
don't they know that you're
full of blame already
yes they know that you
fought yourself another time
decadence isn't easy
slowly recall all your mind
why, your soul's gone cold
and your hope has run dry
dead inside
never enough to forget
that you're one of the lonely
slowly recall all your mind
<♪>
we must scare you now
don't run from me
I've been hiding my pain
you see
said if I scare you now
don't run from me
I've been hiding my pain
you see
slowly recall all your mind
why, your soul's gone cold
and your hope has run dry
dead inside
never enough to forget
that you're one of the lonely
slowly recall all your mind
slowly recall all your mind
say, yes they know that
you fought yourself another time
don't they know that
you're full of blame already
yes they know that you
fought yourself another time
decadence isn't easy, is it
